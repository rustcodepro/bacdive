# bacdive

- Bacdive:Added a complete new webminer and submitting for publication. A complete RUST async analyzer for bacdive database.
- This analyses the isolates table from the [BacDive](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/).
- Now this is a complete API RUST based for the BacDive and analyzes all of them asynchronously.
